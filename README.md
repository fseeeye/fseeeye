- A novice of Computer Graphic
- Dream to work at @Game Science and I'm studying hard.

There are the projects that I'm working at:
- [LearnOpenGL-rs](https://github.com/fseeeye/LearnOpenGL-Rust) : LearnOpenGL written by Rust.
- [EyeEngine-Cpp](https://github.com/fseeeye/EyeEngine-Cpp) : an Real-Time 2D/3D Rednering Engine learning project.
